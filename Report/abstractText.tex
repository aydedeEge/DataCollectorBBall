This project was motivated by the work of David Hunter et al. \cite{picking_winners} where the objective was to predict winning teams in fantasy hockey using integer linear programming. In that project, we consider the problem of picking winners in fantasy basketball using machine learning. The object of the project is two-fold: First, to learn the principles of machine learning. Second, to apply this knowledge outside a theoretical framework, in order to build something tangible. In order to achieve these goals, the design process was broken into three steps: Research, data collection, and implementation. For the first half of this project, work was done in all three of these areas. Specifically, a significant portion of the research was completed, all the data required was collected, and a preliminary working neural network was built. Beyond this, a first iteration of the system architecture was developed. Reading, watching lectures, and following tutorials on project-relevant topics, allowed us to complete the work done thus far.
