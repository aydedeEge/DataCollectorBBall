This project was motivated by the work of David Hunter et al. \cite{picking_winners} where the objective was to predict winning teams in fantasy hockey competitions using integer linear programming. In this project, we consider the problem of picking winning lineups in daily fantasy basketball competitions using machine learning. The objective of this project is to learn the principles of machine learning, and be able to apply those on a large collected dataset from the NBA website in order to predict winning lineups for FanDuel daily NBA competitions. In order to achieve this, the design process was broken into three steps: Research, data collection, and implementation. Most of the research and data collection was performed in the first semester of the design project. During the second semester, the focus was on building a finalized version that could be competitive against real people in these competitions. This system was ultimately successful, producing competitive and profitable lineups.
