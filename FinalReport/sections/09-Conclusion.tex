Our design project has been a success in many ways, although there are still improvements to be made. We were able to design an architecture for our system that allowed us to train a neural network on historic basketball games and use this neural network to predict optimal lineups for future fantasy basketball competitions. These lineups ended up profitable, although not reliably so, and only for a small sample, so far. We plan to improve this system, and make it more reliable through the application of other machine learning techniques and the improvement of the data and scoring system used.
