Our design project has been a success in many ways, although there are still improvements to be made. We were able to design an architecture for our system that allowed us to train a neural network on historic basketball games and use this neural network to predict optimal lineups for future fantasy basketball competitions. These lineups ended up profitable, although not reliably so, and only for a small sample, so far. This system, consisting of three components, including a neural network to estimate player fantasy points on a given day, was tested and cross-validated in order to maximize performance. However, performing a more thorough cross-validation would be the first step in improving its performance. Further to this, we plan to improve this system in other ways. This includes making it more reliable through the application of other machine learning techniques and also the improvement of the data used and the scoring system used.
